![FaceTracking.gif](FaceTracking.gif)

Auto One or Two Face Tracking in iRoopDeepFaceCam takes your deep fake experience to the next level! With this feature, you can track up to two people in a frame on either a webcam or video file. The software automatically detects target faces from the left side of the frame and assigns up to two source faces to two target faces. This feature shines when two people are in the frame, allowing you to deep fake and track one or both faces with ease.

Need to switch things up? You can reset face tracking at any time to switch sides, flip faces, or even detect faces from the right side of the screen. This breakthrough feature, combined with Mouth Mask mode, is incredibly powerful. It seamlessly tracks two people, even when the camera angle changes or the scene shifts, letting them interact naturally and even switch sides in the room. With iRoopDeepFaceCam's face tracking, you'll always know where the person is, making for a smooth and dynamic deep fake experience!

## Live Webcam Buttons

![livecam.jpg](livecam.jpg)

To kick off the Live webcam feature in iRoopDeepFaceCam, just hit the 'Live' button. It takes about 30 seconds for the preview window to pop up. You can adjust the resolution of the live webcam to suit your needs, but keep in mind that higher resolutions may slow down the face swap process. Feel free to switch resolutions based on your computer's power and performance.

No worries about the preview window size—you can resize it independently of the webcam resolution. Want to go full screen? You can make the preview window as large as you like without affecting the deep fake rendering. The rendering will stay smooth, no matter the size of your preview window. Enjoy seamless deep fake fun with complete control over your setup!  

## How do I use it?
> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:

## For the webcam mode

![instruction.jpg](instruction.jpg)

Here's how to get started with iRoopDeepFaceCam:
1. Select a Face: Choose an image with either one or two faces. The left face will be used as Face 1, and the right face will be used as Face 2.
2. Click Live: Hit the 'Live' button to start the live webcam feed.
3. Wait a Few Seconds: It may take 10 to 30 seconds for the preview window to appear, so hang tight as the system prepares.

And that's it! You're all set to start your deep fake adventure. Enjoy the show!

## One/Two face controls for webcam mode, video or image
You can control how a face/s is replaced on target face\s

![FaceControls.jpg](FaceControls.jpg)

1. **Show Both Faces**: Enable this option if your source image has two faces and you want to replace both faces in your webcam feed, video, or image. By default, the left face in the source image is "Face 1" and the right face is "Face 2". If a face goes out of the frame in your video, "Face 1" will be used. To switch which face is used, see the "Flip left/right faces" option below.

2. **Flip Left/Right Faces**: Turn this option on to swap the roles of the faces in your source image. The right face becomes "Face 1" and the left face becomes "Face 2". This is handy for swapping faces in your webcam feed, video, or image when you have one or two faces. 

3. **Detect Face from Right**: Use this feature when you have one target face and the "Show both faces" option is off. By default, faces are detected from the left side of the webcam, video, or image. If you have background elements like a picture frame to the left of the person, this option helps by detecting and replacing "Face 2" first, then "Face 1". This allows you to control which detected face gets replaced first.

These features give you flexible control over your deep fake creations, ensuring you get the results you want!

## How do I install it?

### I strongly recommend you check out [Deep-Live-Cam](https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam) as iRoopDeepFaceCam was based on thier original work. Checkout their [issues](https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam/issues) page as they will more then likely have the solution for you 

### Basic: It is more likely to work on your computer but it will also be very slow. You can follow instructions for the basic install (This usually runs via **CPU**)
#### 1.Setup your platform
-   python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) 
-   [visual studio 2022 runtimes (windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

#### 2. Clone Repository
1. Clone the Repository:
    First, you need to clone the repository to your computer. For this example, we'll use a PC. You can either clone the repository directly to the root drive or into a specific folder of your choice.

2. Choosing a Location:
   You can clone the repository to the root of your C:\ drive or into a specific folder, like C:\iRoopDeepFaceCam. It’s up to your personal preference.
    - Open your command prompt or terminal.
    - Navigate to the root of the C:\ drive or the folder where you want to clone the repository.
        - To navigate to the root drive, you can use:
          
        ```cd C:\```
        - To navigate to a specific folder, use:
        
        ```cd C:\iRoopDeepFaceCam```

    - Run the following command to clone the repository:

        ```git clone https://github.com/iVideoGameBoss/iRoopDeepFaceCam.git```

    If you cloned the repository to the root drive, it will be directly in C:. If you chose a specific folder, navigate to that folder first before running the clone command.

2. Navigate to the Cloned Repository:
   Once the repository has been cloned, you need to navigate into the iRoopDeepFaceCam folder.
    - If you cloned to the root drive, use:

       ```cd iRoopDeepFaceCam```
      
    - If you cloned into a specific folder (e.g., C:\iRoopDeepFaceCam), you would still use:

       ```cd iRoopDeepFaceCam```
        
Regardless of where you cloned the repository, ensure you navigate to the iRoopDeepFaceCam folder to proceed with further instructions.

#### 2. Download Models

 1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/ivideogameboss/iroopdeepfacecam/blob/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
 2. [inswapper_128_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/ivideogameboss/iroopdeepfacecam/blob/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx) *(Note: Use this [replacement version](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion-assets/releases/download/models/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx) if an issue occurs on your computer)*

Then put those 2 files oi the "**models**" folder

#### 3. Setup VENV enviroment. We highly recommend to work with a  `venv`  to avoid issues.

1. Run each command line by line from the iRoopDeepFaceCam you navigated to from the instructinons above

   ```python -m venv venv```
      
   ```cd venv```
      
   ```cd Scripts```
      
   ```activate```
      
   ```cd..```
      
   ```cd..```
      
#### 4. Install dependency
Continuing from the instructions above, you will need to run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It's a good idea to run this command at least twice to ensure all components are installed correctly. Sometimes, running it multiple times may reveal additional files or dependencies that need to be in place for everything to be set up properly.

For MAC OS, You have to install or upgrade python-tk package:
```
brew install python-tk@3.10
```
##### DONE!!! If you dont have any GPU, You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.

#### 6. Proceed if you want to use GPU acceleration (optional)

### Webcam mode on Windows 11 using WSL2 Ubuntu (optional)

<details>
<summary>Click to see the details</summary>

If you want to use WSL2 on Windows 11 you will notice, that Ubuntu WSL2 doesn't come with USB-Webcam support in the Kernel. You need to do two things: Compile the Kernel with the right modules integrated and forward your USB Webcam from Windows to Ubuntu with the usbipd app. Here are detailed Steps:

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up WSL2 Ubuntu with USB webcam support, rebuilding the kernel, and preparing the environment for the Deep-Live-Cam project.  
  
#### 1. Install WSL2 Ubuntu  
  
Install WSL2 Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store or using PowerShell:  
  
#### 2. Enable USB Support in WSL2  
  
1. Install the USB/IP tool for Windows:  
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb)  
  
2. In Windows PowerShell (as Administrator), connect your webcam to WSL:  
  
```powershell  
usbipd list  
usbipd bind --busid x-x # Replace x-x with your webcam's bus ID  
usbipd attach --wsl --busid x-x # Replace x-x with your webcam's bus ID  
```  
 You need to redo the above every time you reboot wsl or re-connect your webcam/usb device.
 
#### 3. Rebuild WSL2 Ubuntu Kernel with USB and Webcam Modules  
  
Follow these steps to rebuild the kernel:  
  
1. Start with this guide: [https://github.com/PINTO0309/wsl2_linux_kernel_usbcam_enable_conf](https://github.com/PINTO0309/wsl2_linux_kernel_usbcam_enable_conf)  
  
2. When you reach the `sudo wget [github.com](http://github.com/)...PINTO0309` step, which won't work for newer kernel versions, follow this video instead or alternatively follow the video tutorial from the beginning: 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_YnACEPmrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_YnACEPmrM)  
  
Additional info: [https://askubuntu.com/questions/1413377/camera-not-working-in-cheese-in-wsl2](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1413377/camera-not-working-in-cheese-in-wsl2)  
  
3. After rebuilding, restart WSL with the new kernel. 
  
#### 4. Set Up Deep-Live-Cam Project  
 Within Ubuntu:
1. Clone the repository:  
  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/iVideoGameBoss/iRoopDeepFaceCam.git
```  

2. Follow the installation instructions in the repository, including cuda toolkit 11.8, make 100% sure it's not cuda toolkit 12.x.  
   
#### 5. Verify and Load Kernel Modules  
  
1. Check if USB and webcam modules are built into the kernel:  
  
```bash  
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep -i "CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS"  
```  
  
2. If modules are loadable (m), not built-in (y), check if the file exists:  
  
```bash  
ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/media/usb/uvc/  
```  
  
3. Load the module and check for errors (optional if built-in):  
  
```bash  
sudo modprobe uvcvideo  
dmesg | tail  
```  
  
4. Verify video devices:  
  
```bash  
sudo ls -al /dev/video*  
```  
  
#### 6. Set Up Permissions  
  
1. Add user to video group and set permissions:  
  
```bash  
sudo usermod -a -G video $USER  
sudo chgrp video /dev/video0 /dev/video1  
sudo chmod 660 /dev/video0 /dev/video1  
```  
  
2. Create a udev rule for permanent permissions:  
  
```bash  
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/81-webcam.rules  
```  
  
Add this content:  
  
```  
KERNEL=="video[0-9]*", GROUP="video", MODE="0660"  
```  
  
3. Reload udev rules:  
  
```bash  
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger  
```  
  
4. Log out and log back into your WSL session.  
  
5. Start Deep-Live-Cam with `python run.py --execution-provider cuda --max-memory 8` where 8 can be changed to the number of GB VRAM of your GPU has, minus 1-2GB. If you have a RTX3080 with 10GB I suggest adding 8GB. Leave some left for Windows.

#### Final Notes  
  
- Steps 6 and 7 may be optional if the modules are built into the kernel and permissions are already set correctly.  
- Always ensure you're using compatible versions of CUDA, ONNX, and other dependencies.  
- If issues persist, consider checking the Deep-Live-Cam project's specific requirements and troubleshooting steps.  
  
By following these steps, you should have a WSL2 Ubuntu environment with USB webcam support ready for the Deep-Live-Cam project. If you encounter any issues, refer back to the specific error messages and troubleshooting steps provided.

#### Troubleshooting CUDA Issues  

If you encounter this error:  
  
```  
[ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Failed to load library [libonnxruntime_providers_cuda.so](http://libonnxruntime_providers_cuda.so/) with error: libcufft.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  
```  
  
Follow these steps:  
  
1. Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8 (ONNX 1.16.3 requires CUDA 11.x, not 12.x):  
[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)  
  select: Linux, x86_64, WSL-Ubuntu, 2.0, deb (local)
2. Check CUDA version:  
  
```bash  
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --version  
```  
  
3. If the wrong version is installed, remove it completely:  
[https://askubuntu.com/questions/530043/removing-nvidia-cuda-toolkit-and-installing-new-one](https://askubuntu.com/questions/530043/removing-nvidia-cuda-toolkit-and-installing-new-one)  
  
4. Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8 again [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive), select: Linux, x86_64, WSL-Ubuntu, 2.0, deb (local)
  
```bash  
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-11-8
